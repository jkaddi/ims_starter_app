# ims-starter-app

This application is intended as a starting point for contestants wanting to create geospatial maps using Predix at the Minds and Machines Hackathon November 2016 in San Francisco. It uses an existing electric utility demonstration dataset that has been pre-loaded into the [Intelligent Mapping service](https://www.predix.io/services/service.html?id=1846) in Predix.io. A live example of this app can be found [here](https://imd-starter-app.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/).
